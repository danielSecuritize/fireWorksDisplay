The program creates a graphical fireworks display using Java's Swing library. Here's an explanation of what it does:

### Overview

1. **Graphical Display**: The program sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate fireworks.
2. **Timer**: It uses a timer to update the display at regular intervals, creating an animation effect.
3. **Firework Creation**: Fireworks are created randomly and added to the display.
4. **Firework Behavior**: Each firework consists of particles that move outward from a central point, mimicking the explosion of real fireworks.
5. **Animation Loop**: The program continuously updates the position of firework particles and redraws the screen to animate the fireworks.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - The main display panel is set up with a black background.
   - A timer is started to trigger updates every 50 milliseconds.

2. **Firework Display Panel**:
   - This panel handles the drawing and updating of fireworks.
   - Each time the timer triggers, the panel decides whether to create a new firework.
   - It then updates the state of all existing fireworks (e.g., their particle positions).

3. **Drawing Fireworks**:
   - The panel clears the previous drawings and redraws all fireworks in their updated positions.
   - Each firework consists of multiple particles, which are drawn as small colored dots.

4. **Firework Creation**:
   - New fireworks are created at random positions along the bottom of the panel.
   - Each firework has particles that move in different directions with varying speeds.

5. **Firework Particles**:
   - Particles move outward from the central explosion point.
   - Over time, particles slow down and eventually stop.

6. **Lifecycle of Fireworks**:
   - Each firework has a limited lifespan.
   - As fireworks age, their particles gradually decelerate and the firework eventually disappears.

7. **Main Application**:
   - The main method sets up a window to contain the fireworks display panel.
   - It ensures the window is the appropriate size and visible to the user.

### Summary

The program creates an animated fireworks display by continuously creating, updating, and drawing fireworks on a graphical panel. The fireworks are made up of particles that spread out and slow down over time, creating a visual effect similar to real fireworks exploding and fading away. The entire process is managed through a timer that triggers updates and repaints the display at regular intervals.
